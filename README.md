### Description
InfraRed Handed is the result of the final project for the 2nd year of the Creative Media and Game Technologies programme at [Saxion, University of Applied Sciences][5]. For this project we had to create a game for the [Oyfo Technical Museum][6]. 

The goal of the project was to create a touchscreen game about a certain subject for kids. The subject was "Frequency".

In InfraRed Handed the main character is breaking into a museum. The museum uses infrared lasers to trigger guards. If the player gets caught by the guards the game is over. The player can use a spray to reveal the lasers and see whether they are on are off.

Besides the programming I was also responsible for the gameplay design and the organisation.
